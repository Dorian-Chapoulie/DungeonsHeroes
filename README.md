# Game

## Executive summary
Dungeons Heroes is a co-op game

In a world of different stages, you and your friend play characters in a dungeon who have to kill all the different monsters in order to progress to new stages and if both of you die ... you have to start all over again until you reach the last stage and finish the dungeon

This game is strongly inspired by the mobile arcade action game:  [Archero](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habby.archero&hl=fr)

We also tried to recreate a Dark Souls atmosphere, notably with music and different sounds directly taken from the game.
