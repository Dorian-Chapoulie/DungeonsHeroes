# Game

## Executive summary
In a world of different stages, you play a hero who has to kill all the monsters in order to progress to new stages and if you die ... you have to start all over again until you reach the last stage

This game is strongly inspired by the mobile arcade action game:  [Archero](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habby.archero&hl=fr)
